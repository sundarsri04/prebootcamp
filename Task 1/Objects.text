OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION

A Javascript Object is a data type which is represented in key value pairs. Almost all the variables in Javascript are instances
of object with their object property shadowed. One such example is the Array in Javascript which has data type as Object.
Internally the Array in Javascript stores values in the Key value format each index being the Key. Hence when the Array is printed
on the console log it shows an Object of Index Keys and value pairs.
