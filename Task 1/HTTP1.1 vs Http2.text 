HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2

HTTP 1.1 : 

# Load Resources one after another. So if one resource canâ€™t be loaded, it blocks all the resources.

# It compresses data by itself.


HTTP 2 :

# It is much faster and more efficient than HTTP 1.1.

# Allows Server push.

# Enables Multiplexing.

# Compress HTTP headers.

# It uses HPACK for data compression.
